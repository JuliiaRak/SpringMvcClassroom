# Classroom Application

This Java Spring Boot Web Application (MVC) can be useful for distance learning. It provides features for user registration, login. User can be whether teacher or student. Each teacher can create "tasks", view created tasks and change them if necessary. Students, whether, can view these assignments, sort them by deadline, and also have the opportunity to sign up for a "queue" for handing in assignments. Also, all teachers act as admins, and therefore have access to the list of users of the application.

The project is built using Java and Maven as a built tool. It uses PostgreSQL as a backend for database management and uses a tomcat server to deploy the application in order to see it working live.
